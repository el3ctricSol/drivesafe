             <div class="panel-body accordioncolor">We'll start with the  "X & Y" (i.e. 1st & 10, 3rd & 7, 4th & 1, etc). The 'Y' stands for how many yards the offense has to move the ball up the field before they get another set of tries to move the ball further up the field, or "downs." The 'X' represents the downs (or tries) and is numbered from 1 to 4. The offense's goal is to move the ball up the field until they reach the opposing team's endzone. <br><br>For example, if the offense is on "1st & 10" (1st of 4 tries to move the ball 10 yards) and on their own 20 yard line, they have to move the ball AT LEAST 10 yards to the 30 yard line to receive a new set of downs. Say the offense only moves the ball 5 yards on their first play; the count would now be 2nd & 5 (2nd of 4 tries to move the ball 5 yards). On the next play, the offense moves the ball 20 yards to the 45-yard line. They have now moved 5 or more yards, and are rewarded with a "1st & 10" on the 45-yard line. <br><br>Now the offense runs into trouble and cannot move the ball more than 5 yards after 3 tries, which puts them at 4th & 5 on the 50-yard line (4th of 4 tries to move the ball 5 yards). Normally, the offense chooses to punt (kick the ball off to the opposing team to give them a try to score), however near the end of a close game, the offense may tempt fate and use their last try to get 5 yards, which would give them 4 more tries to work down the field. If the offense successfully moves 5 yards, the team gets another 4 tries; if they are unsuccessful, they give the ball up to the defense on the spot, giving them better field position to try and score. <br><br>The defense's goal is to stop the offense from reaching the endzone by forcing the offense to use all of 4 of their downs before reaching the endzone, or taking the ball away from the offense, upon which the defense becomes the offense, and vice versa.

              Penalties are bad for the offense and defense. While there are plenty of nuances and hundreds of infractions that can cause a penalty, the biggest costs for the offense are loss of yardage or loss of a down. For example, if a team has 1st & 10 on the 50-yard line and someone commits a penalty that costs the team 10 yards, the next play will start with the offense at 1st & 20 (first of 4 tries to move the ball 20 yards). For other penalties, a loss of a whole down could result in a team losing one of their tries to move the ball down the field. This is good for the defense, because it means one try closer to a turnover, in which the offense and defense switch positions on each team.
